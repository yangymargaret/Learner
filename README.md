Learner: joint transcription factor binding prediction from single-cell multi-omics data using inferred partial labels

Learner is a computational framework consisting of two methods, Learner I and Learner II, to perform genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding prediction from single-cell multi-omics data for a large number of TFs simultaneously. The two methods have shared and distinctive modules, providing flexiblity in usage.
