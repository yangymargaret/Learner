Learner: joint transcription factor binding prediction from single-cell multi-omics data using inferred partial labels

Learner is a computational framework consisting of two methods, Learner I and Learner II, to perform unsupervised genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding prediction from single-cell multi-omics data for a large number of TFs simultaneously. Both methods utilize inferred partial labels for prediction model training, without the requirement for using external experimental data to supervise model training or for TF binding motifs to be detected in the genomic regions. The two methods have shared and distinctive modules, providing flexibility in usage.
